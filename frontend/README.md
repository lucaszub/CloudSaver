# Cloud Saver

---

**Cloud Saver** is an open source tool designed to help teams visualize and analyze their Azure cloud costs with simplicity and clarity. It provides quick insights into cost evolution and identifies the top resource consumers, enabling better cloud cost management.

---

## Current Status

Cloud Saver is currently in active development. The core features are functional, allowing users to:

- View a **daily cost evolution chart** (line chart)
- See the **Top 10 cost-consuming Azure resources** (bar chart)
- Use either **mock data** for testing or real Azure Cost Management API data
- Deploy quickly with a lightweight stack (Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)

The project aims to remain simple to deploy and easy to use, with no mandatory database setup for now.

## Features

### Available now

- Daily cost trends visualization
- Top 10 resource cost breakdown
- Support for mock and real data sources
- Fast deployment with minimal configuration

### Planned features

- Advanced filtering options to explore costs by different dimensions (resource group, tags, time range, etc.)
- Intelligent detection and automated suggestions for cost optimizations
- Multi-cloud support (extending beyond Azure)
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Improved caching and rate limiting handling for API calls
