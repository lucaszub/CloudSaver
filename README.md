Cloud Saver is an open source tool designed to help teams visualize and analyze their Azure cloud costs with simplicity and clarity. It provides quick insights into cost evolution and identifies the top resource consumers, enabling better cloud cost management.

## Current Status

Cloud Saver is currently in active development. The core features are functional, allowing users to:

- View a **daily cost evolution chart** (line chart)
- See the **Top 10 cost-consuming Azure resources** (bar chart)
- Use either **mock data** for testing or real Azure Cost Management API data
- Deploy quickly with a lightweight stack (Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)

The project aims to remain simple to deploy and easy to use, with no mandatory database setup for now.
